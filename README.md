# Ticlj on Jerver

A Tic Tac Toe web app similar to [Taclj][1] but uses [Jerver][2] as
its web server and framework instead of [Joodo][3]. Runs the [Ticlj][4]
Tic Tac Toe game.

All components including the Ticlj Tic Tac Toe game engine, Jerver Java web server
and Ticlj on Jerver web app run without external dependancies aside from
the standard Java libraries and [Hiccup][5] for rendering templates.
